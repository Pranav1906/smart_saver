# YouTube Download Fixes

## Problem
YouTube was requiring authentication ("Sign in to confirm you're not a bot") when trying to download videos using yt-dlp.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Anti-Bot Measures
- Added custom user agent to mimic a real browser
- Added `--no-check-certificates` to bypass SSL issues
- Added `--extractor-args "youtube:player_client=android"` to use Android client
- Added multiple HTTP headers to mimic real browser requests:
  - `Accept-Language:en-US,en;q=0.9`
  - `Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate, br`
  - `DNT:1`
  - `Connection:keep-alive`
  - `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests:1`

### 2. Multiple Fallback Strategies
- **Primary**: Best quality with height limit (1080p) with Android client
- **Secondary**: Best quality without height limit with Android client
- **Tertiary**: Mobile user agent with worst quality (for compatibility)
- **Quaternary**: Web client with no format selection (automatic best)
- **Quinary**: Linux user agent with specific format selection (720p max)
- **Senary**: Default yt-dlp behavior with minimal options

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Specific error messages for authentication issues
- Clear suggestions for users when videos are age-restricted
- Proper HTTP status codes (400 for client errors, 500 for server errors)

### 4. Updated Dependencies
- Updated Dockerfile to use Python virtual environment for yt-dlp installation
- Fixed Alpine Linux PEP 668 compatibility issues
- Added additional system dependencies
- Auto-updates yt-dlp to latest version during build

### 5. Enhanced Error Detection
- Added detection for "Failed to extract any player response" errors
- Better error messages for YouTube API changes
- Version checking in health endpoint

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Test with the original problematic video
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 TEST_URL=https://www.youtube.com/shorts/x1c9Z6JN4QU npm test

# Test with a different video that should work
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm run test-diff

# Test with regular YouTube video (not shorts)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm run test-version

# Or test the endpoints manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/test/youtube \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YOUR_VIDEO_ID"}'
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Test your deployed server
BASE_URL=https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app TEST_URL=https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YOUR_VIDEO_ID npm test
```

## Deployment

### Railway Deployment
1. Push your changes to the repository
2. Railway will automatically rebuild and deploy
3. Check the logs for any issues

### Manual Docker Build
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t smart-saver-backend .

# Run locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 smart-saver-backend

# Test
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Authentication Errors?
1. **Try a different video**: Some videos are age-restricted or private
2. **Check video accessibility**: Use the `/test/youtube` endpoint first
3. **Update yt-dlp**: The Dockerfile now installs the latest version
4. **Check logs**: Look for specific error messages in the deployment logs

### Common Error Messages
- `"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"` → Video requires authentication
- `"Video unavailable"` → Video is private or deleted
- `"There is no video in this post"` → Wrong URL type (Instagram error)

## API Endpoints

### New Test Endpoint
```
POST /test/youtube
{
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID"
}
```

### Updated Download Endpoint
```
POST /download/youtube
{
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID",
  "quality": "best",
  "type": "video"
}
```

## Notes
- The fixes should work for most public YouTube videos
- Age-restricted or private videos will still require authentication
- The mobile fallback strategy helps with some edge cases
- All changes are backward compatible
